# Personal Stack-Queue Project

## Description
This project implements stack and queue data structures in Python. It includes implementations for both simple and ring buffer versions of queues, along with a stack implementation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for testing and demonstrating the functionality of the ring buffer queue.

## Files and Structure
- **Collections.py**: Contains the main logic for handling collections.
- **Queue.py**: Implements the queue data structure.
- **Stack.py**: Implements the stack data structure.
- **Ring Queue Buffer Test.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for testing and demonstrating the ring buffer queue implementation.

## Key Learnings
- Implementing fundamental data structures from scratch.
- Understanding and applying the concepts of stacks and queues.
- Using Python's OOP features to create reusable and efficient data structures.
- Writing and running tests in Jupyter Notebooks to verify the correctness of implementations.
